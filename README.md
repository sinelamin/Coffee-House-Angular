# AngularPracticeBeginer

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.9.

# Description

This project was implemented to practice the basic skills of working with Angular 17:

- Writing components
- Syntax: data binding, conditions, loops, events
- Interaction between components
- Working with Directives
- Working with lifecycle hooks
- Routing
- As a database simulation, JSON was used

The coffee shop template [Coffee-House](https://www.figma.com/design/SAoBmuOqTfguehdT4IFRxQ/Coffee-House?node-id=0-1&t=Kzl0IWoogsPPPrqM-0) was used as a sample.

`The PixelPerfect principle was not followed as it was not a goal in this SPA.`
